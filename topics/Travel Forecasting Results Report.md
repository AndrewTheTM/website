FTA requires documentation of the travel forecasts for projects applying for Section 5309 New Starts funding. This documentation is focused on the forecasts, not the forecasting methods. It consists of a succinct narrative of the benefits of the project and the impacted travel markets, as well as a series of summary tabulations.

The summary tabulations provide the supporting information for the narrative. They include disaggregate district-to-district tables of project trips, auto VMT, systemwide transit trips, socio-economic data, and highway speeds. The summary tabulations can be produced using any travel demand software, Excel, FTA's Summit program, or a combination of software.

A complete description of the Travel Forecast Results Report is located in the [Reporting Instructions](http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/FY_16_NS_Reporting_Instructions_Final.doc).
