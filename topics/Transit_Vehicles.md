Some characteristics of transit vehicles within [Public Transport Modeling](Public_transport_transit_modeling) include:

-   Seated and crush-level capacities - required for a system that accounts for crowding
-   Acceleration, deceleration, and maximum speeds - required if you want to translate to a traffic simulation and do an operational analysis
-   Power source, (i.e. electric, diesel, diesel hybrid) - useful for doing a GHG analysis
-   Number of doors - useful for being able to calculate dwell times as a function of passenger boarding/alighting
