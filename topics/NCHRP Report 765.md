Analytical Travel Forecasting Approaches for Project-Level Planning and Design
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[TRB’s National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 765: Analytical Travel Forecasting Approaches for Project-Level Planning and Design](http://www.trb.org/main/blurbs/170900.aspx) describes methods, data sources, and procedures for producing travel forecasts for highway project-level analyses. This report provides an update to [NCHRP Report 255: Highway Traffic Data for Urbanized Area Project Planning and Design](http://teachamerica.com/tih/PDF/nchrp255.pdf).

In addition to the report, **Appendices A** through **I** from the contractor’s final report are available on a "disc image file" that can be downloaded from [CRP-CD-143](http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_765.iso). These appendices supplement this report by providing a substantial amount of companion data and information. The appendices also include the extended literature review, the detailed NCHRP Report 255 review, supplementary tables, a list of defined acronyms, and a glossary. Also included on CRP-CD-143 are spreadsheet demonstrations, and, for reference purposes, a tool developed by the North Carolina Department of Transportation to assess annual average daily traffic.
