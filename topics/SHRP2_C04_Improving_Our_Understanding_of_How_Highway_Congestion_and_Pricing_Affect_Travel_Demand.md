#### Abstract

TRB’s second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) Report S2-C04-RW-1: Improving Our Understanding of How Highway Congestion and Pricing Affect Travel Demand includes mathematical descriptions of the full range of highway user behavioral responses to congestion, travel time reliability, and pricing. The descriptions included in the report were achieved by mining existing data sets. The report estimates a series of nine utility or generalized cost equations, progressively adding variables of interest.

The report explores the effect on demand and route choice of demographic characteristics, car occupancy, value of travel time, value of travel time reliability, situational variability, and an observed toll aversion bias.
