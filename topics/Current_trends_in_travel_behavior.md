### Effect of telecommuncations on travel behavior

#### Telecommuting

Commute distance, stress, and travel time were found in several studies to have a positive effect on teleworking, supporting the claim that the decision to work at home is based in part on distance to possible workplaces outside of the home [^1] [^2].

One study found that part-time employees tend to telecommute more than full-time employees[^3].

### Housing Location Choices of Young Adults

Recent studies have found trends of young adults preferring to live in more urban areas and travel shorter distances.
