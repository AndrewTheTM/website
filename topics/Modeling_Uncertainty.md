Travel demand modeling is inherently associated with uncertainty. The land use and network inputs that go into future scenario forecasts are uncertain, as are the form and parameter values of the statistical models that comprise a travel demand modeling system. In spite of this uncertainty, the practice in travel demand forecasting has been to generate a point estimate of highway loads, transit ridership, and other critical decision-making statistics. During the past few years, the modeling community has been highlighting the need to move away from treating model outputs as point forecasts and moving towards explaining them as ranges of possible outcomes with associated confidence intervals. With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting travel and activity patterns of people across the globe, the importance of highlighting the uncertainty around travel model forecasts is higher than ever.

Modeling practitioners today are in need of the resources and guidance to practically model uncertainty. A number of academic studies have been published over the last decade in transportation research journals (see reference list) calling attention to the problem. More recently, FHWA has supported the development of a tool called the “Exploratory Modeling and Analysis Tool” or EMAT through an online community for the Travel Model Improvement Portal (TMIP). TMIP-EMAT is a methodological approach to exploratory modeling and analysis. It provides a window to rigorous analytical methods for handling uncertainty and making well informed decisions using travel forecasting models of all types. It is designed to integrate with and enhance an existing transportation model or tool to perform exploratory analysis of a range of possible scenarios. In recent years, TMIP has facilitated numerous [webinars](https://tmip.org/webinars) that provide information on forecasting uncertainty and studies that have used TMIP-EMAT and other tools. Extensive documentation has also been developed for TMIP-EMAT ([Uncertainty in Travel Forecasting: Exploratory Modeling and Analysis TMIP-EMAT: A Desk Reference](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/58168), [https://tmip-emat.github.io/](https://tmip-emat.github.io/)).
