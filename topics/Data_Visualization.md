Data visualization in transportation concerns the visual display of information collected from transportation studies, or to convey information in support or evaluation of transportation policies. There is a great deal of overlap between transportation visualizations and the ideas and mechanics of data visualization more broadly, and this page is not designed to repeat information that is easily available in other places. The page can, however, serve as a "recipe book" for professionals looking for ideas or conventions in transportation visualizations.

*This page is initially created as a summary of discussions at the 2017 Transportation Planning Applications Conference in Raleigh, North Carolina*
