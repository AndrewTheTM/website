Welcome to the Resources section of the Travel Forecasting Resource. Do you have something that has been useful in your travel forecasting work? Please take a minute to create a Resource page and share it here!

**How to create a Resource page you ask?** First, type the title of the Resource you are wanting to add into the Search box above (this will help us avoid having duplicate copies of the same thing posted to the website.) If the Search returns the name of your resource in 'red' text, that indicates the Resource page is not found. Next click on the 'red' link and you will be directed to create the page. Be sure to select and load the appropriate template from the drop down box when you are creating the page - you can choose from publications, presentations, papers and webinars. What -- your resource type isn't in this list?!? Please click on the 'Talk' button above and leave a note for the [Administrators](Administrators) and [TF Resource Volunteers](TF_Resource_Volunteers) so additional resource types can be added to the list of options.

Thank you for your interest in the Travel Forecasting Resource!
