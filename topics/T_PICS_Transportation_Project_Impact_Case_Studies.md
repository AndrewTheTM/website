#### Abstract

The Transportation Project Impact System (TPICS) is a product of the US Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2), project C03, "Impact of Transportation Capacity on Economic Development and Land Use." The prime contractor was Economic Development Research Group, Inc. (EDR Group). The T-PICS web site was designed by EDR Group and built by ICF Consulting. Case studies of highway project impacts that are included in the TPICS system were prepared by a team of EDR Group, Cambridge Systematics, Wilbur Smith Associates, Texas Transportation Institute and Susan Moses Associates. The project was directed by Stephen Andrle and David Plazak of the Transportation Research Board's SHRP2 Program.
