Go to [Project-level traffic forecasting](Project-level_traffic_forecasting) topic page.

National guidelines for project level traffic forecasts are provided in [NCHRP Report 765](NCHRP_Report_765). In many cases, an approved technique for projects in Hawaii is explained fully in this NCHRP report. NCHRP Report 255 has been superseded.

In the absence of local forecasting parameters, it is acceptable to substitute national transferable parameters from one of these documents:

-   “Travel Estimation Techniques for Urban Planning,” [NCHRP Report 365](http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_365.pdf);
-   “Travel Demand Forecasting Parameters and Techniques,” [NCHRP Report 716](http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_716.pdf); or
-   “Long-Distance and Rural Travel. Transferable Parameters for Statewide Travel. Forecasting Models,” [NCHRP Report 735](http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_735.pdf).

Certain techniques mentioned in these topics make specific reference to data tables from these documents. These documents also provide data for reasonableness checks of locally derived parameters.
