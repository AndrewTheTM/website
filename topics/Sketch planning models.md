Summary
-------

Sketch planning models or sketch planning tools may be used by planning agencies to address issues that require a quick turn-around time, particularly in situations where the run-time of the primary regional demand forecasting tool is extensive. The models may be limited to only evaluating network impacts due to network changes (holding mode choice outputs constant).

Sketch planning models are often synonymous with [strategic models](Strategic_Models). Using strategic tools for long range performance-based planning is becoming increasingly valuable as a means to help state and metropolitan area governments select policies and actions to address pressing issues that are fraught with uncertainty. Strategic tools are designed to address a wide range of trends and policies, rather than focusing on details. As a result, many alternative futures and policies can be evaluated, enabling planners to reason more effectively about intended and unintended consequences of prospective policies and test plan resilience to uncertain external influences. Performance metrics set in a strategic phase may be incorporated into subsequent planning, programming and project prioritization processes, as well as monitor plan performance that can in-turn influence long range planning decisions, supportive of long range performance-based planning as outlined in the federal legislation (e.g., Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP‚Äê21) and FAST).
