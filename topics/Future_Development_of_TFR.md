| We would copy the content of tfresource.org to Wikipedia and sunset tfresource.org (or set a re-direct to Wikipedia). TFResource.org and Wikipedia use the same language (MediaWiki), which makes the transfer easier. However, this is not zero effort to transfer, we need a team taking care of this transition. The committee ADB45 might survive organizing the ITM conference, but half of the tasks for this committee would disappear. |

Background Information
----------------------

ADB45 was established in response to a **specific recommendation** found in [Synthesis Report 288 (2007)](SR_288_Metropolitan_Travel_Forecasting_Current_Practice_and_Future_Direction) under the heading "Intergovernmental Cooperation":

-   " A national travel forecasting **handbook** be developed and **kept current** to provide salient information to those practicing travel demand forecasting" (emphasis added)

As ADB45 began work, the "handbook" quickly evolved from a static hardcopy publication to an online environment to facilitate the objective of "keeping current". We experimented with a traditional web-based content management system and concluded that the need for a site-specific webmaster would inhibit community contribution. We settled on a more open "wiki" environment where community members could contribute directly to the site's content.
