Transit crowding is an important consideration in urban areas where the core transit network cannot accommodate demand. There are several ways that transit crowding has been addressed:

1.  Modifying the perceived in-vehicle time to account for the discomfort of being crowded and/or not getting a seat
2.  Modifying the wait time for transit to essentially shadow-price crowded lines (this can be done in many commercial transit route packages)
3.  A modification to the above with a binary, iterative process as opposed to a continuous-iterative process ([as done at SFCTA](SFCTA_Paper_incorporating_crowding))
4.  Manual reassignment of overcrowded transit riders after the completion of the travel model
