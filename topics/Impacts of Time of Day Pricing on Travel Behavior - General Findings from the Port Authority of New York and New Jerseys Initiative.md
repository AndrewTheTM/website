#### Abstract

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey implemented a time of day pricing initiative in March 2001. This initiative provided a discount on off-peak tolls on its facilities. These crossings carry average daily eastbound traffic of 352,000 vehicles, or more than 126 million eastbound vehicles in 2004. This is, by far, the largest application of road pricing in the United States. This report is part of a multi-year research project aimed at studying the behavioral impacts produced by the time of day pricing initiative. The research project focuses on three main areas: user impacts, traffic impacts, and institutional analyses. This paper discusses the key findings pertaining to the impacts produced by the time of day pricing initiative on the behavior of both passenger and commercial vehicle traffic.
