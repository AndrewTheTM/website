#### Abstract

This paper discusses the key findings of a research project aimed at assessing the behavioral impacts of the time of day pricing implementation at the New Jersey Turnpike. The paper analyzes data collected by the authors that included both behavioral and travel patterns before and after the time of day pricing initiative. Analysis results are presented that discuss how many drivers changed their behavior due to implementation of the pricing scheme, what strategies they used to modify their behavior and the elasticity of users traveling short distances compared to those traveling long distances.
