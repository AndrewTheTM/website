The Travel Model Improvement Program (TMIP) was established in 1994 as a partnership of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct research as well as deliver technical assistance and training to local, regional and state transportation planning professionals. A critical part of the TMIP program is the transfer of improved modeling, simulation and analysis technology, techniques and practices to transportation planning staff at state and local planning agencies. Currently, TMIP is funded by the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Planning, Environment and Realty's Surface Transportation Environment and Planning Cooperative Research Program (STEP). The [TMIP website](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/tmip/) and resources have been updated in 2012 to take advantage of new technologies and to improve the flow of information from practice leaders to others in the field.

The TFResource and TMIP staff are working closely together to provide complimentary resources to the profession. As both efforts evolve, the collaborations and leveraging of efforts will also evolve. (See the [Topic Circle](Topic_Circles) on [Associations, Organizations and Committees](Associations_Organizations_and_Committees) for more information on these collaborative efforts.)
