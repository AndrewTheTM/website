*2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM2010)*
----------------------------------------

The HCM 2010 significantly enhances how engineers and
planners assess the traffic and environmental effects of
highway projects by:

-   Providing an integrated multimodal approach to the analysis and evaluation of urban streets from the points of view of automobile drivers, transit passengers, bicyclists, and pedestrians;

<!-- -->

-   Addressing the proper application of microsimulation analysis and the evaluation of the results;

<!-- -->

-   Examining active traffic management in relation to demand and capacity; and

<!-- -->

-   Exploring specific tools and generalized service volume tables to assist planners in quickly sizing future facilities.

The HCM 2010 consists of four volumes:

:   Volume 1: Concepts;
:   
:   Volume 2: Uninterrupted Flow;
:   
:   Volume 3: Interrupted Flow; and
:   
:   Volume 4: Applications Guide (electronic only).

The four-volume format provides information at several levels of detail, to help
users more easily apply and understand the concepts, methodologies, and
potential applications.

Volumes 1, 2, and 3 are available on-line or as a boxed hardcopy set. Volume 4 is electronic only, accessible to registered HCM users via the Internet, and includes four types of content: supplemental chapters on methodological details and emerging issues; interpretations, clarifications, and corrections; comprehensive case studies; and
a technical reference library.

*2016 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 6)*
--------------------------------------

The Highway Capacity Manual, Sixth Edition: A Guide for Multimodal Mobility Analysis (HCM) provides methods for quantifying highway capacity. In its current form, it serves as a fundamental reference on concepts, performance measures, and analysis techniques for evaluating the multimodal operation of streets, highways, freeways, and off-street pathways. The Sixth Edition incorporates the latest research on highway capacity, quality of service, Active Traffic and Demand Management, and travel time reliability and improves the HCM’s chapter outlines. The objective is to help practitioners applying HCM methods understand their basic concepts, computational steps, and outputs. These changes are designed to keep the manual in step with its users’ needs and present times.

HCM has evolved over the years to keep pace with the needs of its users and society, as the focus of surface transportation planning and operations in the United States has moved from designing and constructing the Interstate highway system to managing a complex transportation system that serves a variety of users and travel modes. Providing mobility for people and goods is transportation’s most essential function.

It consists of four dimensions:
•Quantity of travel, the magnitude of use of a transportation facility or service;

•Quality of travel, users’ perceptions of travel on a transportation facility or service with respect to their expectations;

•Accessibility, the ease with which travelers can engage in desired activities; and

•Capacity, the ability of a transportation facility or service to meet the quantity of travel demanded of it.
