#### Abstract

This report chapter presents information on how travelers respond to both the introduction of parking pricing and fees, and to changes in the level, structure, or method of application of parking fees. Included are actions that can change the costs to users of parking even without fee changes, notably through elimination of employer parking subsidies, and fee structures that differentiate by mode of parking (short/long term) or travel (drive-alone/ridesharing). Four comprehensive examples of parking pricing applications are included as case studies.
