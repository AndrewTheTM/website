The technical content on this website is organized into three primary divisions:
  - Principles and Concepts
  - Model Development
  - Model Application and Management


## Principles and Concepts
This section deals with the behavioral and mathematical theory underlying travel
forecast models.

Concepts of Travel Behavior
* Value of Time
* Accessibility
* Induced Demand / Derived Demand / Trip Purposes
* Trip-based and Activity-based distinctions

Travel Behavior Models
* Trip Generation
* Daily activity patterns
* Trip Distribution
* Destination Choice
* Mode Choice
* Time-of-day Choice
* Static Assignment Theory
* Dynamic Assignment Theory
* Land Use Models

Statistics / Econometrics
* Growth rate functions
* Iterative proportional fitting
* Regression analysis
* Choice models
* Advanced choice models
* Coordinated choice models
* Spatial interaction models
* Machine learning / artificial intelligence

## Model Development
This section deals with best practices for developing and delivering travel forecasting models.

Model building blocks
* Travel behavior data
* Networks
* Zones
* Socioeconomic data
* Software for model development
  - Commercial packages
  - Open-source languages
  - Version Control

Model development techniques
* Calibration and Validation
  - Choice models
  - Destination choice models
  - Highway Assignment

Mode-specific considerations
* Freight modeling
* Public transport (transit) modeling
* Active transport (non-motorized) modeling
* Shared mobility
* Autonomous vehicles
* Urban Air Mobility

## Model Application and Management
This section deals with using travel forecasting models within public agencies. Topics include:
* Statewide models
* Strategic models
* Model peer review practices
* Integrated models
* Traffic microsimulation
