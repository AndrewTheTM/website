### Introduction

Activity-travel planning behaviors generally refers to the behavioral processes by which individuals plan, schedule and implement their day-to-day activity and travel plans. Activity-travel planning is a broad topic which encompasses many different traveler behaviors, from the activity conception or generation process, to the decision-making processes by which the activity plan is carried out. These behaviors are represented in many different ways in various conceptional models of activity planning behavior, and are implemented in most activity-based models to some extent.

A good example of a conceptual model of activity-travel planning behavior including household-level decision making, can be found in the paper [Propositions for Modeling household decision-making](Propositions_for_Modeling_household_decision-making) by Miller (2002)[^1].

### Activity Planning Process

### Route Choice

### [Mode Choice Behavior](Mode_Choice_Behavior)

Mode choice involves the selection of which travel mode an individual will use to complete a trip or series of trips (tour). The choice of travel mode is a complicated behavioral process and involves scheduling constraints, availability constraints and optimization over single or multiple trips.

### Activity-Travel Scheduling Behaviors

### [Joint Travel Behavior](Joint_Travel_Behavior)

Joint Travel Behavior refers to how people choose to travel when considering the travel of other household members or persons in their social networks. Children under driving age need to be driven to activities by parents, which requires coordination of household schedules. Household members often need to decide how to share vehicles to conduct daily activities. Some activities are more likely to be conducted with other people, like eating a meal or socializing, whereas other activities are more likely to be conducted alone like commuting to work.
