Finding and training great modelers is always a challenge: both at consulting firms and at public agencies. The skill set required to be a great modeler is in high demand in other industries and it can be difficult to compete.

Recruitment Techniques
----------------------

-   Make pay scale competitive with other industries that require a similar skillset
    -   Save [TMIP listserv](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/tmip/community/list_serv.cfm) postings with salaries for other modeling positions
    -   Look up other job listings with same skill-set
-   Make position name alluring
    -   *Analyst* is not as exciting as *Data Scientist* or *Predictive Analytics Guru*

Desired Skill Set
-----------------

-   Common sense
-   Analytical mind
-   Proficiency with at least one statistical analysis tool
-   Proficiency with at least one programming tool
-   Desire to help society
-   Desire to be a travel modeler

Degrees
-------

The most common degree for travel modelers is transportation/civil engineering. However, **many** successful modelers have come from other degrees. Many travel modelers do have a graduate degree. Common degrees include:

-   Civil / Transportation Engineering
-   City and Regional Planning (paired with a more quantitative degree)
-   Urban Studies (paired with a more quantitative degree)
