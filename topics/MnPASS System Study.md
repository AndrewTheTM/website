#### Abstract

The primary goal of the MnPass System Study was to evaluate and report any relevant data concerning the impacts of overlaying a MnPass toll lane system in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The overall objective of the study was to identify a potential Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Mn PASS tolling lane system and to provide Mn/DOT and the Mettropolitan Council with information on the cost, operational, revenue and system implications of that system. The intent was not to evalue the benefits of tolled versus nontolled capacity expansion, but rather to study a potential future system of express toll lanes.
