Impact of CAV on Traffic Operations
-------------------------------
The areas of impact of CAVs on traffic operations were categorized by Zmud et al, 2018 as follows:
 - Transportation cost
 - Transportation safety
 - Vehicle operations (including capacity changes, congestion, and other traffic impacts)
 - Energy use and related emissions 
 - Personal mobility and convenience (including shared, owned, or rented vehicles)

Because the traffic operations categories need to be accounted for in traffic analysis modeling, the list does not include wider potential societal impacts of CAVs such as land use, employment, or regional economics.  Zmud et al, 2018 points out that transportation cost is a very uncertain impact area. Costs of vehicles that include highly automated technology will need to be recouped by OEMs, so the cost per vehicle is likely to increase. However, the cost per trip may decline if fleet services of AVs prevail in the market. Thus, the overall transportation cost to the consumer is uncertain and is most likely tied to vehicle ownership versus distributed vehicle ownership, vehicle club membership, or ridesharing. 

The safety impacts of CAVs include an expected reduction in crashes, which should increase the utility of AVs, which would increase their market share. Improved reliability would also increase the utility of the network performance itself by encouraging users to travel farther as trip and tour planning becomes more consistent. 

The impacts of CAV operational characteristics are perhaps the most discussed in the industry to date. Much research has focused on the impact of connecting vehicles through DSRC into platoons of vehicles. The overall impact of better connected and more automated vehicles would be to increase capacity, dramatically shorten headway space and thereby improve coordinated acceleration and vehicle throughput, although operations that involve platoon formation and dissolution may decrease capacity (Zmud et al, 2018). This section discusses these and other impacts in more detail.

<b>Capacity</b>

Several studies exploring the operational impacts of CAVs estimate that deployment of CAVs in traffic in significant numbers may have a positive effect on capacity, increasing that capacity as the portion of CAVs increases. 

Zmud et al, 2018 noted that CAVs are expected to improve traffic flow and total throughput capacity on freeways. This would be because of CAVâ€™s ability to use close headway spacing and coordinated speed control to form platoons. In a mixed traffic stream of CAVs and manually operated vehicles, fewer gains in capacity are expected as platoons form and dissolve and weaving occurs. Some speculation about exclusive use of managed lanes for CAVs exists. Using a physical separation from manually operated vehicles could enable CAVs to take advantage of capacity-enhancing operation.

Mahmassani, 2016 looked at following distances and capacity improvements with CAVs at various penetration rates.  The paper differentiated CVs from AVs and assumed CAVs could follow at 73 feet, whereas Manual Vehicles (MVs) would need 146 feet.  Table 1 is derived from Vovsha and Vyas, 2018 and postulates a doubling of lane capacity at full penetration of AVs.  The study team emphasizes that the timing of such full penetration of CAVs is very uncertain and no specific date is included in Vovsha and Vyas, 2018. There is no field test or operational data that can substantiate the model findings in Table 2 of doubling capacity with 100% AVs.
