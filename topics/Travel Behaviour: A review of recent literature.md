#### Abstract

This paper presents a review of literature in the travel behavior analysis field from the period of approximately 2001-2006. The authors were focusing on the analysis of factors which influenced travel behavior in order to analyze the impact of transit oriented developments on travel. The review focused primarily on work deriving from the design and analysis of household travel surveys and on determining travel behavior sensitivities from them, while also reviewing work presenting conceptual models of travel behavior and other reviews of previous work. Overall 96 papers were reviewed.
