## Introduction
Markov transition (chain) models are used within land use models to model non-spatial events such as:
-   Household socio-demographic changes (except household relocation)
-   Real estate renovation and deterioration
-   Firmographic changes (except firm relocation)

The use of Markov transition models within land use models is discussed in more detail [here](Design_principles_of_land_use_models).  

Please see the following external resources for more general information on Markov transition models.
