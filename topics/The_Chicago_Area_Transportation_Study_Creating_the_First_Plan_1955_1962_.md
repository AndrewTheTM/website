#### Abstract

This is a historical account of one of the earliest systematic metropolitan transportation studies in the U.S., the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS). This period in CATS' history is widely recognized as establishing both the policy template and technical methods eventually codified as the 3C planning process undertaken by MPOs nationally. Written in a firsthand, non-academic, almost folksy, style by Andy Plummer who retired from CATS in 2000 after about 40 years.
