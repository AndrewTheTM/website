#### Abstract

Economists have long advocated comprehensive roadway pricing in the form of user charges as the most efficient way to allocate scarce roadway capacity among competing travel demands. Actual transport policy, however, lags far behind theories of optimal pricing. In the U.S., the only form of roadway pricing that currently exists is the tolling of a small fraction of the nation's bridges, tunnels, and limited access highways. Most t olled roadways are in the Northeast, and by far the highest concentration is in the New York City region.
