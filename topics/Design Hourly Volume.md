Design hourly volume (DHV) is the number of vehicles that travel through a segment of roadway during the design hour. The DHV is used for making roadway structural and capacity design decisions because traffic volume varies by hour and from day to day throughout the year. The formula for calculating the DHV is:

DHV = K \* [AADT](Average_Annual_Daily_Traffic)
