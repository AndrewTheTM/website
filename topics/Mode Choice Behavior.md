Mode Choice Behavior
====================

[Mode choice](Mode_choice) is a key aspect of travel demand modeling. The choice of travel mode is a complicated behavioral process and as such is a core focus in [Travel Behavior](Travel_Behavior). More detail about [Mode choice](Mode_choice) modeling, as opposed to [Mode Choice Behavior](Mode_Choice_Behavior) can be found in the [Mode choice](Mode_choice) topic circle.

The Victoria Transport Institute has determined the prevalence of short trips made by automobile from the National Household Travel Survey[^1]. They found that in the U.S, 10% of trips were less than 0.5 miles, 9% of trips were more than 0.5 miles and less than one mile, and 22% of trips were more than one mile and less than 3 miles. The automobile mode share was 34% for trips less than 0.5 miles, 51% for trips 0.5 to one mile, and 88% for trips one to three miles. These summaries of the National Household Travel Survey demonstrate the large potential base for mode shifts without changing peopleâ€™s [destination choices](Destination_Choice_Models).

National Survey of Bicyclist and Pedestrian Attitudes and Behaviors found that 13% of bicyclists felt threatened for their personal safety the last time they rode[^2].
