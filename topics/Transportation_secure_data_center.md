### **Transportation Secure Data Center:**

Real-World Data for Planning, Modeling, and Analysis

The Transportation Secure Data Center (TSDC) at [www.nrel.gov/tsdc](http://www.nrel.gov/tsdc) provides free, web-based access to detailed transportation data from a variety of travel surveys conducted across the nation.

While preserving the privacy of survey participants, this online repository makes vital transportation data broadly available to users from the comfort of their own desks via a secure online connection.

### Data Available through the TSDC

Maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in partnership with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the TSDC houses data from travel surveys and studies conducted using GPS devices. It features millions of data points—second-by-second GPS readings, vehicle characteristics (if applicable), and demographics—for all modes of travel.

NREL screens the initial data for quality control, translates each data set into a consistent format, and interprets the data for spatial analysis. NREL’s processing routines add information such as road grades and join data points to the road network.

### Valuable to Planners, Researchers, and Manufacturers

Using archived data can reduce research costs and save public funds. This valuable transportation data can be used for applications such as:

-   Transit planning and travel demand modeling
-   Congestion mitigation research
-   Emissions and air pollution modeling
-   Vehicle energy and power analysis
-   Homeland Security evacuation planning
-   Alternative fuel station planning
-   Validating transportation data from other sources
-   Toll and pricing research.
