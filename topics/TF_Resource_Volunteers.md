## ADB45 Special Committee for Travel Forecasting Resources

TRB Special Committee for Travel Forecasting Resources (ADB45) [members](https://www.mytrb.org/CommitteeDetails.aspx?CMTID=3709) are responsible for the technical content of this wiki. Committee members are expected to actively contribute to one or more areas under ADB45’s charge and document their contributions within the tresource.org wiki environment. The contributions of committee Friends are greatly appreciated.

The most important committee's tasks include:

- Manage wiki content on [tfresource.org](http://tfresource.org)
- Organize, promote, and document TRB’s biennial \[<http://tfresource.or> ADB45 Member and Friends are listed by their current **role**. Interested to get involved? Feel free to sign up (see orange box on the top right) and start contributing to the team.

### Wiki Review Tasks

At the committee meeting on 25 June 2018, it was decided that all topics deserve a careful review by a committee friend or member. It was considered to be preferable to have this review done by a person who did not write most of the original content. A link to each topic can be found [here](Topic_Circles#Subcategories) under the header Subcategories. See <Talk:TF_Resource_Volunteers> for guidance.
