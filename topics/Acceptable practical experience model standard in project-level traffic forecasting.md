An acceptable practical experience model is typical of the better models used for travel forecasting in the United States. Those models are four-step or activity-based, but only three steps are absolutely required for project-level traffic forecasting. The specification of an acceptable model constitutes minimum expectations as follows:

-   Ability to perform trip generation with procedures from NCHRP Report 365, NCHRP Report 716 or similar;
-   Ability to perform trip distribution with a gravity model or a destination choice model or similar;
-   Ability to perform equilibrium traffic assignments with feedback to trip distribution;
-   Ability to assign traffic for a single peak hour using pre-assignment time-of-day factors; and
-   Meets standards of the “Travel Model Validation and Reasonableness Checking Manual II” and validates to within the standard of first column in the Table in [Quality assurance and validation standards](Quality_assurance_and_validation_standards_in_project-level_traffic_forecasting) for traffic volumes in the base case.
