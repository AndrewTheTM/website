TODO

There are varying levels of detail at which pedestrian route choice can be incorporated into the skimming process. At a higher level, a straight distance minimization function can be used to find the shortest path. At the other end of the spectrum, one can represent a multitude of factors that may go into the route choice of pedestrians such as pedestrian facilities, hills, distance, amenities, and other factors that may affect walkability.
