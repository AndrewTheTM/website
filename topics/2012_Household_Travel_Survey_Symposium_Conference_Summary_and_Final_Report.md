#### Abstract

The SWUTC Travel Survey Symposium was held in Dallas on November 8 and 9. More than 70 travel survey professionals attended this event from across the United States, from Florida to Alaska, with one attendee from the City of Calgary (Canada), representing an almost equal mix of agency, consultant, and academic researchers. The symposium started with a poster session, featuring research from 22 related efforts. An opening session followed that included a Texas welcome from Mr. Michael Morris, Executive Director of NCTCOG and a key note speech from Dr. Kermit Wies of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Attendees were encouraged to think outside the box and consider all users of travel survey data as their customers.

The symposium was divided into two parts. The discussion groups on Thursday focused on identifying lessons learned and opportunities to advance methods and sampling approaches, as well as considering all uses of the survey data. The day ended with attendees presenting their versions of the “travel survey of the future”—incorporating new technologies, known and on the horizon. Friday, the focus of the symposium discussion turned to identifying what can be implemented now and establishing a research agenda to move us toward the newly identified survey designs.
