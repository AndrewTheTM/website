#### Abstract

This study examined the feasibility of introducing high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes in the Atlanta road network as a method to provide safe reliable trips throughout the region and to maximize the use of the current and future high occupancy vehicle (HOV) system. The study was in response to Georgia Senate Resolution (SR) 575 that requested “a comprehensive study of the feasibility of implementing HOT lanes along the highways of the metropolitan Atlanta area and implementing HOV and HOT lanes along the GA 400 Corridor.”
