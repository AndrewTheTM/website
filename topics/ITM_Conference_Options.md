In the past, the TRB committee ADB45 has organized the [Innovations in Travel Modeling Conference](http://itmconference.com/) every other year. As this committee will be shut down by TRB in April 2020, we need to discuss options how to move forward (or not) with the ITM Conference. 

Feel free to add your thoughts to this table.
