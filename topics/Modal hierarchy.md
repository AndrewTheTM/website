Modal hierarchy is useful in being able to "name" the "main mode" that a person has taken when they have taken multiple modes to complete a trip.

An example modal hierarchy could be:

1.  Subway
2.  Express Bus
3.  Local Bus

If an individual did the following to get from O --&gt; D, using the hierarchy above, Subway would be the *main mode*, and the choice that this would fall under in the mode choice model would be *Kiss and Ride to Subway* even though the drop-off occurred at the express bus station.

-   Got dropped off at bus station
-   Express Bus to downtown
-   Walked from bus station to subway station
-   Took subway across town
-   Walked from subway to destination
