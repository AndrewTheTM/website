Summary
-------

Many travel modelers obtained their education through one or more traditional fields of study, but were also able to extend their knowledge through on-the-job experience. Someone interested in pursuing a career in travel modeling and has enough time to plan a curriculum may benefit from this recommendation by the TRB’s Committee on Transportation Demand Forecasting and TRB’s Subcommitee on Statewide Travel Demand Forecasting.

Courses and Areas of Study
--------------------------

The following topics should be covered in a college program through a master’s or doctoral level curriculum for anyone wanting to fully participate in a travel modeling group immediately upon graduation from college.

The curriculum could potentially be housed in any of the following program areas

-   Civil engineering
-   Dual engineering/planning
-   Applied computer science
-   Applied mathematics
-   Statistics
-   Operations research/management science/logistics
-   Geography
-   Interdisciplinary degree program
