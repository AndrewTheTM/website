title: "Travel Forecasting Results Report"

FTA requires documentation of the travel forecasts for projects applying for Section 5309 [New Starts funding](https://www.transit.dot.gov/CIG). This documentation is focused on the forecasts, not the forecasting methods. It consists of a succinct narrative of the benefits of the project and the impacted travel markets, as well as a series of summary tabulations.

The summary tabulations provide the supporting information for the narrative. They include disaggregate district-to-district tables of project trips, auto VMT, systemwide transit trips, socio-economic data, and highway speeds. The summary tabulations can be produced using any travel demand software, Excel, FTA's Summit program, or a combination of software.

The documentation gets updated over time. As an example, the documentation updated in July 2019 is located in the [Reporting Instructions](http://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/funding/grant-programs/capital-investments/8886/fy-21-ss-reporting-instructions-final.doc).
