Summary
-------

Time of day factoring is a popular, elementary method of estimating the amount of travel occurring within hourly or multihour time periods. Time of day factoring has particular relevance to [Trip-Based Models](Trip-Based_Models). Standard time of day factors have been published in NCHRP Report 187, NCHRP Report 365, and NCHRP Report 716. Separate factors are required for each purpose (e.g., HBW, HBO, NHB) and for each direction of travel (production-to-attraction and attraction-to-production) for each hour of interest. Time of day factoring typically converts a 24-hour PA (production-to-attraction) trip table to an OD (origin-destination) trip table for a specific time period.
