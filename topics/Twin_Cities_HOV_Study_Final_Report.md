*Twin Cities HOV Study - Final Report*

#### Author

Cambridge Systematics, Inc.

#### Source

Minnesota DOT

#### Abstract

This study uses travel demand modeling and market research methodologies to evaluate the potential traffic flow, safety and economic impacts of opening the HOV lanes on both I-394 and I-35W without changing actual lane operation. As a secondary research, it also reviews current trends in HOV deployment across the country and to compare these trends with the operation of HOV lanes in the Twin Cities. The study was in response to Bill H.F 1054 requested that “Mn/DOT conduct a study of how opening the High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes on I-394 to general-purpose traffic would impact traffic flow and safety.”
