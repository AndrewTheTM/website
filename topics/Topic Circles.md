[Topics](Topic_Circles) are the curated categories used to group content within this wiki.

Wiki's lack the structured content of information found in most traditional documents featuring a table of contents. Rather, they follow the topical structure of an encyclopedia, where each topic or section – wiki page in this instance – is at the same level as all of the others. Cross-references are used to link similar items together.

The [committee](https://www.mytrb.org/CommitteeDetails.aspx?CMTID=3709) has adopted the wiki concept of [circles](Topic_Circles) to help organize the review of TF Resource content and identify major topics for targeted attention. The following topics are part of TF Resource at this time.

Have an idea for a new Topic? Registered contributors can add topic pages or make suggestions for additional content by following the talk button at the top of any page and leaving a comment.

Thank you for your interest in the Travel Forecasting Resource.
