The 3rd TRB Conference on Innovations in Travel Modeling (ITM2010) was held at the Tempe Mission Palms Hotel and Conference Center at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona during May 10-12, 2010. The conference was attended by more than 200 academics and practitioners from the public and private sector enterprises. The conference included a mix of workshops, parallel sessions, plenary sessions, and interactive discussion sessions. A variety of networking events were also held as part of the conference.

The Innovations in Travel Modeling (ITM) Conference Series was started in 2006 with a view to facilitate exchange of information between researchers and practitioners that would aid in moving new and advanced travel modeling methods into practice. The conference series has served a critical role in helping bring the research and practitioner communities together. Conferences are held every even year (alternating with the Transportation Planning Applications Conference Series).
