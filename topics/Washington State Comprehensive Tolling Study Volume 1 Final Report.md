#### Abstract

The study is to help Washington State make policy-level decisions on if, where, when and how to toll by providing a practical step-by-step tolling strategy for the State. Eight policy questions were asked and investigated in the report. The answers were used to test some of the key ideas as well as to elect the illustrative examples of potential toll projects. A set of recommended policies were proposed intended to guide Washington as it develops toll facilities in the State. Legal issues that might be involved in implementing the policies were also analyzed.
