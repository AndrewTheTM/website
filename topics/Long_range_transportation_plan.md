**Long Range Transportation Plan**
"A document resulting from regional or statewide collaboration and consensus on a region or state's transportation system, and serving as the defining vision for the region's or state's transportation systems and services. In metropolitan areas, the plan indicates all of the transportation improvements scheduled for funding over the next 20 years." - [FHWA](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/glossary/glossary_listing.cfm?TitleStart=L)

Long-range transportation plans take place at a variety of geographic levels:

-   Statewide, conducted by State DOTs
-   Regional, a key function of [Metropolitan Planning Organizations](Metropolitan_Planning_Organization)
-   Local, less common, but can be conducted by counties, cities, or other local jurisdictions
