# Start Here: index of all topics

The pages on TF Resource are loosely divided into sections on models, data, practical applications/use cases, and finally a glossary.

Sometimes it's hard for us to pick just one place for a page. So, we've also implemented a system of **category tags** (sometimes known as "Topic Circles"). These work just like tags on any regular blog: they help us to collect related pages into useful and overlapping groups.

Below is a summary of every page in the topics section. Soon we'll add tag/category search, sort by most recent updates, and other features as needed.
