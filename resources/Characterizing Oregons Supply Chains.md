#### Abstract

In many regions throughout the world, freight models are used to aid infrastructure investment and
policy decisions. Since freight is such an integral part of efficient supply chains, more realistic
transportation models can be of greater assistance. Transportation models in general have been moving
away from the traditional four-step model into activity-based and supply chain-based models. Personal
transportation models take into consideration household demographics and why families travel.
Freight research has yet to fully identify the relationships between truck movements and company
characteristics, so most freight models use the methodology of personal transportation models, despite
situational differences. In an effort to classify freight companies into groupings with differentiated
travel movements, a survey of licensed motor carriers was designed and conducted in Oregon. The
survey consisted of 33 questions. Respondents were asked about their vehicle fleets, locations served,
times traveled, types of deliveries, and commodities. An analysis of the data revealed clusters of
company types that can be distinguished by determining characteristics such as their role in a supply
chain, facilities operated, commodity type, and vehicle types. An assessment of how the relationships
found can be integrated into state models is also presented.
