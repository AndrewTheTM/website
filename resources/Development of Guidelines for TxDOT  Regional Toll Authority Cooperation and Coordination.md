#### Abstract

This report presents the results of a research project developing guidelines for TxDOT – regional toll authority cooperation and coordination. The report summarizes the use of toll authorities and new institutional arrangements in other states. It also highlights examples of coordination between TxDOT and toll authorities in Texas. Common themes from the national and state case studies are presented, along with the differences and similarities between state transportation agencies and toll authorities.
The report includes the guidelines for TxDOT – regional toll authority cooperation and coordination. The guidelines cover the areas of planning, environmental review, funding, design, construction, monitoring and evaluation, and management and operations. The guidelines are flexible to meet the unique characteristics and needs of different areas, while providing a common direction for all groups involved in toll projects. They provide guidance for agency staff involved in toll projects, rather than mandating a specific approach.
