#### Abstract

This report details the results generated by a nationwide online freight establishment study.
The survey was assembled with the intention of allowing the formulation or enhancement of new or existing
freight-demand microsimulation models. Within this report is an overview of the steps taken in designing and
implementing the establishment and shipment questionnaires of the freight survey. Following that is a
descriptive analysis of the results of key questions posed in our survey. Over the course of the study, 966 usable
establishment surveys and 1,844 shipment forms were collected and assembled in a database, an adequate
number for modeling purposes.
