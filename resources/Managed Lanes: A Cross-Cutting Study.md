The intent of the report is to review the state-of-the-art in managed lanes in order to increase the understanding of (1) what managed lanes are, (2) how to plan for implementation, (3) what operational and design issues are considered, and (4) how active management of the lanes over the life of the facility affect its implementation. This report describes operating managed lane projects through a case study approach, highlighting best practices of the projects the lessons learned. Emerging issues and knowledge gaps are also presented. The intent of the report is to provide a cross-cutting study of the issues and experiences of various agencies as managed lane projects are implemented and policies are drafted.
