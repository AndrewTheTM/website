#### Abstract

This research project developed a decision-making framework that includes descriptions and evaluation of methods and analytical tools for establishing pricing policies and practices and for predicting their impacts on travel behavior and congestion. Gaps are identified, and improved methods and analytical tools are developed to fill those gaps. Improvements for travel-demand forecasting methods employed to support pricing decisions for new capacity and congestion management are provided. The results are presented two volumes: the first containing the decision-making framework and the second focusing on improvements to travel-demand forecasting methods and analytical tools.
