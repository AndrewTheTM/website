2.0 The Generic Travel Survey Process
=====================================

2.1 The Survey Implementation Process
-------------------------------------

Most travel surveys (and other types of surveys, as well) follow a common implementation procedure. Backstrom and Hursh-Cesar (YEAR??) divide the generic survey implementation process into the 20 steps listed in Table 2.1.[1](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote1sym "sdfootnote1anc") These 20 steps can be classified into the five general stages shown in the figure (WHICH FIGURE?):

* Survey planning,

* Survey design,

* Field implementation,

* Data preparation, and

* Data analysis.

  


This manual concentrates on the threemiddle stages: survey design, field implementation, and datapreparation. The survey planning and data analysis stages are relatedto decisions about the scopes and the forms of the travel models andother analyses that are to be developed using survey data. For thismanual, it is assumed that the agency has either developed a detailedplan for the formation or revision of an existing modeling system orhas identified a particular set of survey data needs. 

  


Figure 2.1 shows the many functionalrelationships between the steps in the implementation of a generictravel survey. Decisions made at each point of the process affect manyother elements of the survey effort. Once the need for a new travelsurvey has been identified, an agency needs to proceed with threetasks: compiling useful background information for the survey effort,designing the overall survey effort based on the recognized data needsand available data sources, and organizing the survey

**WORDS MISSING HERE... team and survey resources. Decisions made during the survey designprocess allow the survey team to develop a sampling plan and to developthe preliminary survey instruments.

  


The field implementation stage of thetravel survey involves the training of fieldworkers, conducting asurvey pretest, and the actual survey data collection. The surveypretest allows the survey team to rethink survey design issues,including the overall design of the survey, the survey samplingprocedures, and the survey instruments. In addition, the pretest canidentify areas where additional fieldworker training would be helpful.

The results of the data collectioneffort are then fed into the data preparation stage. The survey resultsare coded, entered, and cleaned. Then the survey results aremanipulated into useful formats for data analysis.

Chapters 6.0 through 12.0 apply thegeneric organization of survey steps to discuss specific types oftravel surveys. In the remainder of this chapter, we briefly elaborateon each of the survey implementation steps.

2.2 The Survey Design Stage
---------------------------

### Assembling Background Information

Prior to embarking on any survey datacollection effort, an agency should carefully review existing datasources. Available travel data can be used in a number of ways,including:

* **In Lieu of New Survey Work** – Travelsurveys are often expensive and time-consuming. If appropriate,existing data sources can be used instead of the survey data. Ofcourse, the quality and timeliness of existing data sources should beexamined to determine whether new survey data collection may be avoided.

* **For Developing Survey Samples** –Existing information about the survey population can be used to developmore efficient samples so survey costs can be reduced and/or accuracycan be enhanced.

* **For Validating Survey Results** – Oneof the best ways to assess the validity of new survey results anddetect potential biases in the data is to compare the survey resultswith other available information. This process can be accomplished withformal statistical analyses or with non-formal comparisons. Manystatistical validation routines are commonly performed during thedevelopment of new travel models.

  


Background data sources for each type oftravel survey are described in Chapters 6.0 through 12.0 of thismanual, but generally, the most common sources of backgroundinformation for travel surveys include:

* U.S. Census Population and Housing Summary Tape Files (STF1, STF2, STF3, STF4);

* U.S. Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP);

* U.S. Census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS);

* National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and its predecessor the Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS);

* Previous local survey efforts; and

* Traffic counts and transit passenger counts.

### Survey Design

In the survey design portion of thetravel survey implementation process, the survey team needs todetermine the best overall survey approach to obtain the particulardata items required for the expected analyses. The survey designersneed to accomplish two general tasks during the survey design effort:

* Selection of the general survey methods; and

* Establishment of budget and time constraints for the survey effort.

Ideally, the appropriate survey methodswould be determined first, and then the budget and time constraintswould be defined based on the selected approach. Usually, however, thesurvey method is selected with advance knowledge of the likely budgetand schedule limitations. Thus, the challenge is to design the surveymethod or methods that will yield the most cost-effective datacollection effort.

Regardless of whether the survey team isconstrained by available resources, the selected survey methods shouldbe based on anticipated data analysis needs. The decisions to be madein this regard include:

* **Which survey methods are appropriate, and which are likely to be the most effective at obtaining the needed modeling data?**As this manual will demonstrate, there are several different methodsfor completing each type of travel survey. The key design issue facingthe survey team is which survey method is the most effective forobtaining the needed survey data. The strengths and weaknesses ofdifferent survey methods are discussed in Chapter 3.0. Later chaptersdiscuss the choice of survey methods for specific types of surveys.

* **Which individuals or establishments should be included in the sample population?**The respondent population for travel survey efforts will depend on theparticular survey data needs of an agency. For instance, if a survey isto be conducted as part of an effort to predict the effects of apotential transit fare increase, the best survey population is likelyto be current transit riders. If the survey is being used to predictthe effects of transit improvements, the best survey population wouldinclude both current transit riders and potential users.

* **What sampling frame or frames areavailable for sampling the relevant survey population? Do thesesampling frames imply the use of any particular survey method, orexclude the use of any?** To conduct a survey, one needs to somehowenumerate (or list) the sample population so that a sample can bedrawn. It is rare to find a perfect sampling frame, so the survey teamneeds to find or develop the best possible frame given availableresources. Many lists are related to a particular survey method. Forinstance, some transit agencies maintain lists of riders and theirtelephone numbers that have been obtained from previous surveys. Ifsuch a list is to be used as a sampling frame, then the survey wouldhave to employ a telephone method.

* **Should special measures be employed to enhance the likely respondent cooperation rate?**Travel surveyors have employed many mechanisms to increase surveyresponse rates, including monetary incentives, letters ofencouragement, and the personalization of survey materials forindividual respondents. Since these mechanisms generally increase thecost of surveys, survey teams need to determine which of these toemploy in a particular survey.

* **What procedures are needed to ensure thatgroups that are difficult to survey are included in the survey effort?What needs to be done to assure that respondents’ language and literacy limitations do not significantly bias survey results?**Travel survey populations often include a number of subpopulations thatare particularly difficult to survey. Travel survey designers need totake steps to encourage members of these groups to participate to themaximum extent possible.

* **What techniques are available (and whichshould be used) for obtaining the survey response data given aparticular survey method?** Travel surveyors have conducted travelsurveys using a number of data retrieval techniques. Mail surveys (andother self-administered surveys) have been conducted using standardquestionnaires, bubble forms (similar to the forms used to recordanswers on standardized tests, like the SAT), and scratch-off forms, inwhich respondents can complete without a pen or pencil. Personalinterview and telephone survey results can be recorded usingpencil-and-paper techniques or by using a computer-assisted approach(CAPI or CATI).

### Organization

In the organizational stage of thesurvey implementation process, the survey team defines the logisticalrequirements of the survey effort, and determines how the availablesurvey resources are to be allocated. The organization task includesdetermining the following:

* Staff needs (including numbers and required special skills);

* The need for consultant contract help;

* The level of expertise required of interviewers and other fieldworkers;

* Field supervision needs;

* The need for special facilities;

* Equipment needs;

* Coordination needs (local agencies, police, etc.); and

* Citizens’ participation and publicity needs.

### Sampling

Almost all travel surveys rely uponsampling techniques in which a part of a total population is queried tomake inferences about the population as a whole. Sampling a population,rather than conducting a full population census, has the followingadvantages:[2](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote2sym "sdfootnote2anc")

* Economy;

* Speed and timeliness;

* Feasibility; and

* Quality and accuracy (data collection for a census maybe so difficult that the quality of data would be poorer than sampledata).

The challenge facing the survey team isto select a sampling approach and sample sizes that will enable thedevelopment of reliable, accurate transportation demand models withoutoverspending on an expensive data collection effort.

In theory, developing a statistically reliable survey sample involves the following steps:

* Identification of the survey population (or universe);

* Identification of sampling frame and selection of sampling procedures;

* Determination of necessary precision (sampling error) for one or more specific data items being collected;

* Calculation of sample size; and

* Estimation of necessary resources.

In practice, the survey design processwill likely be constrained by the available resources from thebeginning. While an agency might be able to reduce costs by reducingthe amount of data collected for each unit or adopting procedures fromelsewhere, the steps would still likely have to be modified to moreclosely resemble the following:

* Determination of available resources;

* Identification of survey population;

* Identification of sampling frame and selection of sampling procedures;

* Determination of maximum sample size based on procedures and resources;

* Determination of survey precision for one or more data items being collected; and

* Assessment of the adequacy of precision levels.

The Sample Design Workshop of theSecond International Conference on New Survey Methods in Transport(AUTHOR & YEAR?) found that:

“Littleformal effort is usually given to the analyses of sample sizerequirements, primarily because budgets were almost invariably setprior to the technical involvement of the transportation analyst. Thesebudgets reflect the expectations of administrators as to the cost ofparticular items of information, rather than any explicitconsiderations of required accuracy.”[3](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote3sym "sdfootnote3anc")

  


The Workshop also identified thedifficulty of determining necessary precision levels as a reason forfirst identifying the resource constraints, and then determining theresulting survey parameters:

  


“Theidea that there might be a single optimal allocation of resources wasseen as an oversimplification, in that the end use of the data isgenerally an input to a large number of very different, butinterdependent analyses. No single, most important output could bedefined, so no natural criterion for optimality could exist.”[4](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote4sym "sdfootnote4anc")

  


The basic principles of sampling fortravel surveys are outlined in Chapter 5.0 of the manual. Latersections identify the most commonly used survey populations, samplingframes and sampling procedures for each type of travel survey. Thesesampling approaches are all variations and combinations of the mostcommon sampling procedures:

  


* **Simple Random Sampling** – With this approach, sampling units are drawn randomly from the sample frame.
* **Systematic Sampling** – With thisapproach, rather than randomly selecting from the sampling frame, theanalyst selects sampling units in sequences separated by a presetinterval. Provided that the sampling frame order is relativelyunbiased, this approach is essentially equivalent to the simple randomsample. Often, in personal intercept surveys, fieldworkers areinstructed to approach every `nth’person passing a certain point. Similarly, random-digit-dialing (RDD)telephone surveys are often conducted by calling every `nth’ telephone number within a prespecified set of telephone exchanges.
* **Stratified Sampling** – If data areavailable to segment the survey population into subpopulations (orstrata) prior to the sample selection, then this sampling approach mayhelp to reduce sampling error or to reduce the amount of datacollection needed. Household travel surveys commonly use stratifiedsamples, based on measures such as household size and automobileavailability.
* **Cluster Sampling** – With thisapproach, the sampling units are actually groups (clusters) of thesurvey elements rather than individual elements. All of the unitswithin a selected cluster may be included in the sample, or a secondstage subsample may be drawn from the chosen cluster.Workplace/establishment surveys are examples of cluster surveys. Somesmall number of establishments are first selected from the populationof all establishments within a study area. Employees and visitors arethen sampled within the selected establishments.
* **Choice-based Sampling** – When thedata analyses require significant representation of a group or groupswhich are difficult to locate in the population at large, a sample maybe drawn on the basis of the outcome of one of the choice processesunder study. A common example of choice-based sampling is thecollection of data from transit users on board transit vehicles for usein the development of mode choice models.

  


A number of textbooks deal with the details of survey sampling.[5](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote5sym "sdfootnote5anc"),[6](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote6sym "sdfootnote6anc"),[7](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote7sym "sdfootnote7anc")[(THESE CITATIONS ARE FROM 1965 THROUGH 1979 & NEED UPDATING)](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote7sym "sdfootnote7anc")

### Drafting and Constructing

The earlier steps of the surveyimplementation process dictate the types of survey forms that will beneeded and the respondent information that will be required from thesurvey. Of particular importance will be the survey administrationmethodology; specifically, whether responses to survey questions willbe completed by respondents or by trained interviewers. In thequestionnaire drafting and construction step, the survey team developsthe data collection instruments. The following tasks are needed fordeveloping the actual survey instruments:

* Identification of the required survey instruments and related forms;

* Selection of the types and forms of the questions that will best address the data needs;

* Formulation of wording for the survey questions;

* Determination of the best sequencing for the questions;

* Refinement of the questionnaire to ensure that all questions are effective and necessary; and

* Design of the layout of the survey instruments.

2.3 The Field Implementation Stage
----------------------------------

### Pretesting

All travel surveys should be testedextensively before they are actually undertaken. Nearly all surveyresearchers stress the necessity and importance of pretestingquestionnaires, but this is the stage of the survey implementationprocess which is most likely to be squeezed out due to time and costpressures.[8](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote8sym "sdfootnote8anc")If the pretest is conducted appropriately, the surveyor will be able toimprove the survey effort on a number of different fronts, including:

* Refining fieldworker and interviewer procedures and logistics;

* Testing and revising question wording, sequencing, and formatting;

* Comparing alternative approaches to gathering certain data items;

* Identifying unexpected responses and respondent behavior;

* Estimating the survey completion time; and

* Developing preliminary estimates of the variance in key variables to help establish final sample sizes.

  


If possible, travel survey pretestsshould be conducted in three steps: the office pretest, thequestionnaire pretest, and the survey dry-run.

#### Office Pretest

The office pretest, whether conductedformally or informally, is likely to be the best mechanism foridentifying problems with the questionnaire and with specificquestions. Many researchers feel that the best way to discoverpotential survey problems before they occur is to have colleagues orother experts not involved directly in the survey design review thequestionnaire and proposed procedures.[9](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote9sym "sdfootnote9anc")Two recent studies of pretest error detection rates support thisthesis. These empirical studies found that pretests that rely solely onsamples drawn from the ultimate target population have fairly low errordetection rates.[10](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote10sym "sdfootnote10anc"),[11](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote11sym "sdfootnote11anc")

#### Questionnaire Pretest

Although it is an important element oftesting the questionnaire, the office pretest will be insufficient inmost cases. Travel survey questionnaires should be tested onnon-experts because they are often confusing to people withoutknowledge of transportation planning, and because the surveys oftenrely upon respondents’understanding of technical (and sometimes ambiguous) terms andexpressions. For instance, a common challenge in travel surveys of alltypes is to get respondents to use a consistent definition for theterm, “trip.”The questionnaire pretest is the stage of the survey implementationprocess that ensures that respondents are answering in a consistentmanner.

During the questionnaire pretest,respondents are administered the survey, and are asked to describe anyproblems or areas of confusion that they encounter. Often, thesepretests are personally administered even when the ultimate survey willnot be. It is becoming increasingly popular to conduct this portion ofthe pretest as part of a formal or informal focus group. This allowsthe analyst to observe first-hand how respondents react to the survey. 

There are two procedures used to determine the respondents’ reactions to the questionnaire. In the “protocol” method, the respondent is asked to think out loud as the questionnaire is being completed. In the “debriefing” method, the respondent completes the questionnaire and then talks about the questionnaire afterwards.[12](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote12sym "sdfootnote12anc")The protocol method is generally the better approach for identifyingproblems with specific questions; the debriefing approach is the betterapproach for identifying question sequencing and respondent tiring.Some surveyors have split the pretest so that some respondents use theprotocol approach while others are debriefed.

#### The Survey Dry-Run

The final step of the pretesting taskis to complete the survey on a small number of respondents in anidentical manner to the full survey effort. Ideally, the pretest wouldencompass the whole range of survey tasks from sample selection to dataanalysis. This will ensure that all aspects of the survey effort are inplace, and are operating as expected prior to the beginning of any datacollection. 

Sometimes, when the survey dry-run goeswell, and the pretest timing and sample design are consistent with thelarger effort, the data can be used in the general survey effort.However, surveyors need to allocate their time and money resources sothat they are prepared to make changes in the questionnaire andprocedures based on the outcome of the survey dry-run. If problems arefound, the questionnaire(s) and/or survey procedures should be modifiedand re-tested if necessary. Ideally, this means that pretests would becompleted well in advance (often a month or more) of the actual survey.

### Training and Briefing

The quality of the fieldworkers, andinterviewers in particular, will have a major effect on the success ofthe survey effort. Assembling a group of well-trained and consistentfieldworkers is not an easy task because of the nature of the work.Survey fieldwork is low-paying, generally part-time, intermittent workrequiring the individual to have schedule flexibility, often during theevenings. The job requires excellent communication skills andreasonably good reading and writing skills. In addition, some travelsurveys require fieldworkers to have a high level of mobility. 

In many cases, direct supervision offieldworkers is minimal, so they must be carefully trained and briefedon the travel survey effort. Training involves teaching or re-teachingthe basic fieldwork skills necessary for a survey of the type beingconducted. Training should include the following topics:[13](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote13sym "sdfootnote13anc"),[14](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote14sym "sdfootnote14anc")

1. Use of survey quota sheets, maps, building layouts, etc. (for field surveys).

- Procedures for observing or counting individuals and for recording the information (field surveys).

- Procedures for contacting potential respondents and presenting the study to them (or reminding them of the study).

- Procedures for screening potentialrespondents based on survey quotas or other criteria to determinewhether to ask a particular person to participate.

- The conventions used in the design ofthe questionnaire with respect to wording and skip instructions so thatinterviewers can ask the questions in a consistent and standardized way.

- Procedures for using computer-assisted questionnaires (CAPI and CATI surveys).

- Procedures for probing inadequate answers in a non-directive way.

- Procedures for recording answers to open-ended and closed questions.

- Rules and guidelines for handling the interpersonal aspects of the interview in a non-biasing way.

The fieldworker briefing provides thefieldworkers with specific information regarding the particular study.Generally, it is extremely helpful for the sponsoring agency to bedirectly involved in the briefing of fieldworkers, because agencypersonnel will best be able to describe the importance of the surveyeffort to their future efforts. Briefing issues include the following:[15](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote15sym "sdfootnote15anc"),[16](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote16sym "sdfootnote16anc")

1. Specific purposes of the project,including the sponsorship, the general analysis goals, and anticipateduses of the research. Fieldworkers need this information because theywill need to provide respondents and others with appropriate answers toquestions and because this information will help fieldworkers enlistcooperation.

- Description of everything in the fieldworker kit (for field surveys).

- Description of how the forms are to becompleted (pencil-and-paper approach) or how responses are to berecorded on the computer (CAPI and CATI).

- The specific approach that was used forsampling, again to provide a basis for answering respondent questions.In addition, there may be some training required in how to implementthe basic sample design.

- Details regarding the purposes of specific questions.

- The specific steps that will be takenwith respect to confidentiality, and the kinds of assurances that areappropriate to give to respondents.

- Detailed description of procedures to follow if problems are encountered.

- Procedures for contacting field supervisors (field surveys) or central location supervisors (telephone surveys).

In addition to providing fieldworkerswith an understanding of the procedures to be employed in the study,the training and briefing sessions should motivate fieldworkers tobelieve that the survey work and their efforts are important, and thatthe highest quality data are needed. The participation of personnelfrom the sponsoring agency in the training/  
briefing sessions may help fieldworkers understand the importance of their work. 

Under ideal circumstances, the training and briefing sessions should impart the following attitudes to the fieldworkers:[17](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote17sym "sdfootnote17anc")

* **This Job is Important –** Stress theimportance of this particular study: how it is intended to contributeto the public good, solve problems, and improve the community.

* **I Must Follow Instructions–** Teach the importance of following instructions, the necessity of proper field procedures, and the importance of consistency.

* **Biases can Cripple Data –** Teach fieldworkers about the destructive role of the biases that they can bring into the research effort.

* **Research is Important –** Communicatethe value of research: how re-search information improves our abilityto make decisions, to solve problems, to contribute to the common goalsof society, and to save money and resources.

* **Surveys Work –** Stress that surveys can be valid, reliable measures of people’s information, attitudes, preferences, and behavior.

* **People Like to Participate in Surveys –**Help fieldworkers understand that they are not snoops or irritants:many people like to express their opinions, they know about polls, theyare usually flattered to be chosen, and they are curious about how itall works.

* **I Am a Professional –** Each fieldworker should believe: “I have a job to do; I am a professional being paid for services rendered.”

* **Randomness Works –** Each fieldworker should believe: “nomatter what I think about who should be part of the sample, we arelikely to get a better (more fairly representative) sample by relyingon chance and the survey selection procedures, rather than personaldecisions about whom to interview.”

* **The Respondent is Entitled to Courtesy –** Each fieldworker should understand that “I must respect the people whose time I am using, and I must treat all respondents with equal courtesy.”

* **The Respondent is Entitled to Privacy –**Warn that respondents usually are more comfortable expressingthemselves privately on some issues, so fieldworkers must help toensure that privacy.

### Interviewing and Questionnaire Distribution

The data collection fieldwork tasks ofthe survey implementation process are where the considerable planningefforts of the survey designer are actually put to the test.Unfortunately, these data collection tasks are usually those over whichthe designer has the least control. They are also the tasks where thegreatest amount of uncorrectable bias can enter the process. Majorinterviewer and fieldworker errors are very costly because they mayrequire redoing part or all of the fieldwork, but small errors byinterviewers and fieldworkers may be as bad. These smaller errors areoften undetectable, and may greatly increase the level of bias in thesurvey results, unbeknownst to those analyzing the data.

To ensure that fieldworkers areperforming the necessary survey functions in the non-biasing andconsistent manner for which they have been trained, adequatesupervision is essential. For some types of surveys, such as telephonesurveys, supervision techniques have been developed that help toidentify problems and help interviewers to correct them immediately.For instance, central site telephone survey supervisors can maintainup-to-the-moment statistics on interviewer completion rates, averagecompletion times, and item non-response levels. Telephone surveysupervisors can usually monitor individual interviews if problems withparticular interviewers are detected. However, the cost and logisticsof supervision for some types of surveys, such as in-home personalinterviews, can be prohibitive.

Some key issues for fieldwork supervisors in evaluating the fieldwork as it occurs are the following:

* Are the survey response rates and cooperation rates different than expected prior to the survey fieldwork?

* Are the costs per completed interview different than expected prior to the survey?

* Is the quality of the completed questionnaires and interviews – response rates, validity of responses, legibility – as expected?

* Are survey fieldwork procedures working adequately? Are staff being utilized efficiently?

* Are fieldworkers completing their tasks consistently?

* Are survey response rates and cooperation ratessignificantly lower or higher than the average for a specificfieldworker (a low response rate will affect survey cost while a highresponse rate might suggest improper survey techniques)?

If problems are detected during thefieldwork process, the survey team should be ready to modify theprocedures or retrain (or replace) fieldworkers, as necessary. Suchmodifications are generally very challenging since the availableinformation on which to make decisions is limited, and the underlyingreasons for the detected problem(s) are usually not obvious.

2.4 The Data Preparation Stage
------------------------------

### Coding and Data Entry

During the coding step of the surveyprocess, the raw survey data are translated into codes usable for modeldevelopment and presentation of results. The objective of the surveyteam in this step is to “unambiguously assign each survey answer to one and only one analytically meaningful code.”[18](https://docs.google.com/RawDocContents?docID=ddc43dqc_0hmdqs9hs&justBody=false&revision=_latest×tamp=1216701130868&editMode=true&strip=true#sdfootnote18sym "sdfootnote18anc") 

Most travel surveys rely on a three-step process for converting responses to usable data:

1. The respondent or fieldworker records a response;

- The coder translates the response into a pre-specified code; and

- The data entry specialist keys the response into a database.

Many survey instruments can be designed to be “self-coding”without damaging the clarity of the questions. These surveys greatlyreduce or eliminate the work of the coder. In addition, the interactiveprocessing available with computer assisted telephone interview (CATI)and computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) surveys reduce thesesteps to a single automated step. Computer assisted survey techniquesalso allow interviewers to check for the reasonableness of responsesvis-à-vis other responses in the interview, and to correct problemsprior to losing contact with the respondent.

Of particular interest are recentimprovements in technologies to perform geocoding, the translation oflocational survey data into a usable format. Chapter 14.0 discussesgeocoding issues in some detail.

### Editing and Cleaning

Once the survey data have been entered,the survey team should systematically analyze the results to identifydata problems. Three editing and cleaning tasks can be conducted:

1. Simple data cleaning to correct coding and data entry problems;

- Validation of survey responses; and

- Application of analytical techniques to reduce non-response.

The first step is to verify thecompleteness of each record. Next, each data field should be checked tomake sure only legal codes are entered. Then, the analyst shouldevaluate the internal consistency of the responses to relatedquestions. 

Manual checking of the survey data bysurveyors or editors is essential, but writing specialized programs toperform automated checking of data files is usually also worthwhile.Such programs can consistently perform intra- and inter-record datachecks that would be impossible to perform manually. For example, asurvey record might include the beginning and ending time of anactivity or trip with associated “am” or “pm”codes. If one of the codes is mis-keyed, the resulting data could implythat the activity or trip ended before it began, even though all datapassed specified range checks. 

Likewise, a household included in ahome interview survey might have five members. If data for one of thehousehold members was skipped in data entry, the error would never becaught via simple range checks of specific data items. Survey data thatare “clean”in terms of range checks for specific data items often containillogical data. Such errors can affect resulting data summaries andtravel models.

If problems are identified with aparticular response, the analyst should refer to the original sources,the completed interview sheets or the returned questionnaires. Theerror(s) in the database should be corrected if possible, but if theerror involves more than coding and entry errors, the record will needto be marked unusable and dropped from the analysis database. As onewould expect, tracking down and correcting errors in large surveydatabases is a long, slow, and inefficient process. It is generallymuch more cost-effective to spend extra time on the coding and dataentry tasks to avoid large editing tasks.

CATI and CAPI surveys offer theopportunity to perform data cleaning and consistency checks on-line,while respondents are still accessible, but one of the drawbacks ofcomputer-assisted interview surveys is that there is no source which torefer to when incorrect or inconsistent data are found in the databaseafter the survey. Therefore, it is essential that editing, cleaning,and consistency checks be built into the programs. If operators enterinvalid information during an interview, the computer should promptthem to try again.

The second editing/cleaning task thatis sometimes performed is to validate a small sample of the surveyresponses by recontacting respondents and reviewing their responses.This process can be conducted on a random sample basis to ensure thateach fieldworker completed the work he or she was supposed to complete,and to ensure that responses were completed consistently. Thevalidation process can also be used selectively if there is somequestion about the work of certain fieldworkers. Finally, validationcan be used for responses with identified problems to limit the numberof non-usable responses.

The final editing task available toanalysts is to apply statistical procedures to impute the values ofmissing or incorrect data elements. In almost every survey, somerespondents will be unwilling or unable to answer all the questionsposed to them. In addition, many respondents will knowingly orunknowingly respond to questions inaccurately. Some question types aremore susceptible to item non-response and inaccuracy than others, withquestions about income generally being the most problematic. Someanalysts have statistically related the variable in question to othersurvey variables or other data sources, such as Census data, to be ableto use the response more effectively in subsequent analyses. 

This approach is still much debated,however, since bias could be increased in some cases, and because manyanalysts believe that imputing values implies that the answer to thequestion is already known. The survey team has other options, including:

* Ignoring the non-response (if the sample size is sufficient without them); and

* Using a modeling variable to describe the non-response.

These and other mechanisms for reducing non-response are discussed in later chapters.

### Programming and Compiling

The final steps of the survey processcovered in this manual relate to preparing the survey data for modelingand other analyses. Fortunately, the task of compiling survey datasetshas been greatly simplified since the days of the previous TravelSurvey Manual, when piles of perforated computer cards awaited theanalyst. Today, survey data are generally entered in ASCII data fileswhich are easily read into any of the available statistical analysissoftware packages. Thus, the compilation task is quite straightforward.

However, there are three key programming and compiling tasks that are of special interest to the modeling analyst:

* The determination of data storage needs;

* The development of one or more survey response weighting schemes; and

* The tabulation of survey results.

Large survey efforts require a greatdeal of data storage. Often, the survey database from a travel surveywill use in excess of 60 megabytes, excluding any constructed variablesor analysis results (which could easily double the size of the file).The survey team should make rough calculations of the data storagerequirements once the survey coding requirements are known, and shouldplan to invest in expanded storage if necessary.

The determination of survey weights isa key element of the survey analysis. Depending on the modelinganalysis needs, results obtained from surveys that are designed to (oraccidentally) oversample or undersample some groups of the populationusually need to be weighted so that members of the subgroups areproportionally represented in the population as a whole. Some analyseswill require the use of the weighted data while others will not. Often,different weighting schemes are used depending on the analysis that isbeing applied.

Tables 2.2 and 2.3 illustrate twoweighting exercises. Table 2.2 shows the calculation of work trip modeweights for a recent household travel survey. The first columns of thetable shows the modal distribution of work trips obtained from a surveyof 8,346 work trips. The following columns show the actual modaldistribution for the study area based on best available information,including the Census Journey-to-Work data. To make conclusions aboutthe work trip mode split from the survey data, it is

necessaryto weight each survey response by the ratio of the actual share dividedby the survey share. For instance, the survey work trips that were madeby walking need to be weighted by (191,614/6,931,237)/(33/8,346) = 6.99.

Table 2.3 illustrates another common weighting exercise. As discussed below, transit onboard surveys generally sample transit trips. To make conclusions about transit riders, one needs to weight the survey results by individuals’ frequency of transit usage. The example shows survey results for a question about the respondents’choices of fare types. Monthly pass trips accounted for 50 percent ofthe surveyed trips, but because monthly pass users use transit morefrequently (based on another survey question) they represent only 39percent of transit users. Users of the data would want to use theweighted percentages to make conclusions about riders, and theunweighted percentages to make conclusions about transit trips.

The final programming task is thetabulation and cross-tabulation of the raw and weighted survey results.Because the survey team will usually soon be immersed in detailed andtime-consuming model estimation efforts, a useful final step for thesurvey work is to produce a complete set of cross-tabulations of thesurvey results. The tabulations will be a useful reference source forthe analyst while he or she develops the travel models, and they willprovide interested, less technical parties with a great deal ofinformation on the survey population under study. For most agencies, itis advantageous to produce travel survey results reports as quickly aspossible. These reports will provide funding agencies and otherinterested groups and individuals with evidence that the travel surveyeffort was more than a purely academic effort used to develop obscuremodeling parameters.

The preparation of clear, concise datadocumentation is an important task. Too often, final datasets aredocumented by a list of variables and a copy of the survey instruments.A data dictionary that clearly delineates the file format(s) and thedata contained in each field should be prepared, including allowablecodes and meanings. This is especially true if derived variables (suchas zone numbers) or independently estimated information (such asweighting factors) have been added to the dataset.

Finally, care must be taken to ensureconfidentiality of the data. Many surveys collect personalinformation – number of household members, ages of household members,household income, typical daily travel patterns, and householdaddresses. Such a database could be a valuable tool to a “high-tech” thief. Care should be taken to ensure that data files containing personal information are never distributed with detailed address or locational data (e.g., latitude and longitude).
