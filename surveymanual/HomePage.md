**A Dynamic Document for Transportation Professionals** 

Provided by the Members and Friends of the Transportation Research Board’s **Travel Survey Methods Committee** (ABJ40) 

Please contact the Manual’s **Webmaster** (Professor Lei Zhang, [lei@umd.edu](mailto:lei@umd.edu), Krishnan Viswanathan, [kviswanathan@camsys.com](mailto:viswanathank@cdmsmith.com)) for any questions regarding this On-Line Travel Survey Manual (including access for online editing). 

For Committee-related questions, please visit the **Committee website**: <http://www.travelsurveymethods.org/>. 

**FOREWORD** 

The committee wishes to acknowledge the tremendous contributions of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program’s (NCHRP’s) Report 571 and its technical appendix (titled Standardized Procedures for Personal Travel Surveys, authored by Peter Stopher and teammates) and the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA’s) 1996 *Travel Survey Manual* (authored by Kevin Tierney and teammates). These two documents are the basis for the great majority of content contained herein.[[1]](/HomePage.html#_ftn1)  Both the sponsoring agencies and underlying authors have granted permission to use the documents for purposes of this forum, and the Committee is indebted. 

This new on-line and editable *Travel Survey Manual* is the vision of Elaine Murakami, who had rallied for an update of the original Manual for several years.  Key contributors in getting the Manual to this point are Kevin Tierney and Nanda Srinivasan, who provided HTML and MS Word files of all prior-report chapters; Krishnan Viswanathan, who organized reviewer teams while providing technical expertise; Sharon O’Connor, who provided on-line access to the documents and Google editing tools; Kara Kockelman, chair of TRB’s Travel Survey Methods Committee, for managing much of the overall process; and, finally, the many members and friends of ABJ40 (hailing from around the world) who have contributed their time to review, merge, and enhance existing and new materials. 

Transportation professionals across the globe look forward to the on-line edits that the travel survey community and others will provide, as the Committee seeks to keep this “living document”, and supporting documents (including example surveys and survey contracts), up to date.

The Travel Survey Methods Committee is incredibly fortunate to have such talented individuals as contributors to this Manual, and as Friends and Members of the Committee.  They have taken much time out of their busy schedules to develop to these chapters.  Of course, nothing is ever complete, particularly as the field and practice of travel survey design and implementation evolve over time.  We encourage others with survey expertise to enhance and extend these chapters, to make them of greatest use to the world at large.
