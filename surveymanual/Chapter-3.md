3.0   Options for Travel Surveys
===============================

This chapter describes the different types of travelsurveys, the general types of survey data typically sought in each type oftravel survey, and the available survey methods currently being used for eachtype of travel survey.

 3.1   TheTypes of Travel Surveys
---------------------------------

This manual discusses the seven most common types oftravel surveys used to learn more about (and to model) the behavior of users ofhighway and transit facilities.  Each ofthe survey types provides a unique perspective for input into travel demandmodels, so the selection of the appropriate travel survey type should be basedon the development or revision plans for the models themselves.

### Household Travel/Activity Surveys

Traditionally, the most important building block for urbanand regional travel demand models has been the household travel survey.  In a household travel survey, respondents arecontacted in their homes and are queried about their household characteristics,the personal characteristics of members of the household, and about recenttravel experiences of some or all household members.

Household travel surveys have been conducted in the UnitedStates for more than 40 years, but because of the extensive effort required,most regions have conducted only one or two of these surveys.  The first generation of household travelsurveys are characterized by those that were conducted in the 1960s to addressthe requirements of the FHWA’s3‑C planning process.  These surveys wereconducted by sampling households in the region and sending survey staff to thehouseholds to solicit cooperation and to conduct interviews.  In some cases, the survey workers left surveymaterials, including travel diaries for each household member for an upcomingperiod of time and then returned to collect the travel information, but usually the surveys asked respondentsabout recent past travel.

Usually, the primaryfocus of the household survey was to assemble origin-destination databased on fairly coarse zone systems.  TheU.S. Department of Transportation’ssample size recommendations for household surveys ranged from one dwelling unitout of 25 for study area populations over one million people, to one dwellingunit out of five for study area populations under 50,000 people.  The same guidelines set the range of “minimum sample sizes” to between one out of 100dwelling units for the largest areas, to one out of 10 dwelling units for thesmallest areas. 

Most planning agencies developed their four-steptransportation demand models primarily from the data that they gathered intheir 1960s household surveys.  In manycases, these models continued to rely on the 1960s household survey data forthe next 20 to 30 years.

The first generation in-home survey method was consideredto be the acceptable procedure for household travel surveys throughout the1970s and the first part of the 1980s, though significantly fewer majorhousehold survey efforts occurred in this period than the precedingperiod.  

During the 1980s, planners began to recognize the need forupdated household travel data.  However,the new household survey methods that survey designers employed weresignificantly different than the earlier efforts.  In the past several years, most householdtravel surveys have been conducted by using telephone or mail surveys or somecombination of the two.  In addition,typical sample sizes measured as a percentage of the survey universe have beenreduced to one-quarter to one percent of study area dwelling units.  This decrease in sample size has lead to verylittle decrease in the overall accuracy of the survey results because the newersurveys rely on more efficient stratified sampling techniques and becausemodelers generally apply disaggregate modeling techniques to developorigin-destination data, rather than rely solely on the survey data.  Collecting travel data through diariesinstead of through recall techniques is now common practice, and many recentsurveys have redefined the diary unit from the simple trip to more detailedelements of the trip, or to activities that can be related to trip making.

Several factors contributed to the development of thesecond generation of household travel surveys in the U.S.  The most important factor was the need toreduce the high costs-per-interview and logistical difficulties of the in-homeinterview.  Advances in commercial marketresearch allowed transportation planners to develop alternativeapproaches.  At the same time, developmentsin travel model research and inadequacies in traditional travel models havelead planners to consider issues such as trip-chaining, activity-basedmodeling, and time-of-day modeling.

Despite the changes, the household travel or activitysurvey remains the best source of regional trip generation and distributiondata for most regions.  It is highlylikely that household travel and activity surveys will be central to thedevelopment of microsimulation-based modeling systems, like TRANSIMS.

In addition to being used for developing, revising, andupdating regional modeling efforts, household travel surveys are being used inthe following ways:

·      Some transit agencies use household travelsurveys to conduct surveys of transit users and non-users in theirregions.  The surveys are used toestimate transit market share and to assess differences between actual transitusers and potential users.

·      Agencies haveperformed household travel surveys in advance of major infrastructureprojects to help assess the potential demand and to determine the level ofpublic support.

·      Agencies sometimes perform household travelsurveys simply to increase their understanding of travel in their regions, andto be able to address specific questions that policymakers may raise.

A renewed research interest in the household travel andactivity survey is demonstrated by the recent Transportation Research BoardConference on Household Travel Surveys: New Concepts and Research Needs. In recent years, research on household travel and activity surveysconducted in Europe and Australia has beenparticularly interesting because many planners in those countries are trying to develop advanced modeling techniques, but with much better surveyclimates than in North America.  Recentpublications by Richardson, Ampt, and Meyburg and by Axhausen provide someinformation on these international survey efforts.[[1]](#_ftn1 "_ftnref1"),[[2]](#_ftn2 "_ftnref2")  Chapter 6.0 describes the typical procedures used to conduct household travelsurveys.

### Vehicle Intercept and External Surveys

Vehicle intercept survey data are used by travel demandmodelers for three purposes:

·      To provide origin-destination data and otherdata on trips that come into or go out of the model study area for modelinginternal-external and external-external trips (external survey);

·      To provide origin-destination data and otherdata for auto travelers in a particular corridor for sub-area and small areamodels; and

·      To provide origin-destination data and otherdata for auto travelers crossing important internal cordons, screenlines, andcutlines that can be used for travel model validation.

Unlike the household surveys, these surveys rely onintercepting or observing people in the course of travel.  These surveys are conducted by stoppingvehicles and then interviewing drivers or distributing mailback questionnairesto them, or by observing vehicle license plates and then recontacting theowners of the vehicles.  Traditionally,these surveys have focused on gathering information on the particular tripbeing made at the time of the intercept withlittle emphasis on other information. Chapter 7.0 describes the typical procedures used in the collectionof vehicle intercept and external surveys.

### Transit Onboard Surveys

Transit onboard surveys are similar to the vehicle surveysin that they are intercept surveys and use a choice-based sample population (tobe eligible for the survey, the respondent has both decided to travel and touse the particular mode of interest). Transit onboard surveys are generally conducted for two reasons:

·      To provide modelers with transit triporigin-destination data and transit rider characteristics, which in manyregions is very difficult to obtain from the household survey because transittrips may make up a very small proportion of total trips; and

·      To provide transit planners with ridership datathat will allow them to analyze changes in service. 

Generally, transitonboard surveys collect trip-specific travel data and some limitedrespondent information.  Often, plannersare interested in surveying both users and non-users (or infrequent users) oftransit services.  This is generallyaccomplished by using a combination of transit onboard surveys and eitherhousehold travel survey techniques or vehicle intercept survey techniques.  Chapter 8.0 describes the issues relatedto transit onboard surveys.

### Commercial Vehicle Surveys

Travel demand modeling for commercial vehicles is somewhatprimitive compared to passenger travel modeling.  However, ISTEA’sintermodal planning requirements have addedto the importance of commercial vehicle data collection.  Some information on commercial vehicle travelcan be obtained through household surveys and vehicle intercept surveys, butthe only way to accurately analyze the universe of commercial vehicle trips isthrough a commercial vehicle survey.

Commercial vehicle surveys are used primarily to obtainorigin and destination data for trucks, taxis and other commercialvehicles.  Recent efforts have also begunto obtain more detailed trip purpose and truck contents information.  This information canbe used in the development of disaggregate urban commodity flowmodels.  Chapter 9.0 discussescommercial vehicle surveys.

### Workplace and Establishment Surveys

Establishment surveys are used to collect travelinformation about trip attraction sites. These surveys generally collect traveler characteristics and trip originand destination data.  Typically,workplace surveys are designed as intercept surveys where respondents aresurveyed as they enter or leave their workplace or another establishment.  In some cases, workplace surveys arecentrally distributed to employees by employers or employer transportationmanagement agencies.  In these cases, thesurvey method is more of a general population survey, like the householdsurvey.

A special application of the workplace/establishmentsurvey is the special generator survey. Special generator land uses are unique to a region (such as an airport,university, or large shopping mall), or they attract and produce significantly more trips than would beindicated by their employment, square footage, or land area.  Since trip rates to and from these sitesmight be significantly different, surveys of trips to and from these locationscan be especially useful. Chapter 10.0 presents descriptions of workplace, establishment, andspecial generator surveys.

### Hotel/Visitor Surveys

In many parts of the country, a large percentage of thedaily regional travel is conducted by visitors or tourists to the region.  In some of these areas, planners have sought,or are seeking, to develop visitor travel demand models.  The household travel or activity survey couldbe used to account for some of this travel if data are collected from visitorsstaying in local residents’homes.  However, visitors staying inhotels, motels, or other lodging would elude the household survey, and thereare likely to be significant differences between the travel patterns of thosevisitors staying with residents and those who pay for their accommodations.

Visitor travel could theoretically be surveyed by one ofthe intercept methods discussed in Chapters 7.0 and 8.0 (transit onboardor vehicle intercept), but collecting the needed trip generation informationwith these survey methods would be practically impossible.  To obtain the necessary visitor data, some metropolitan areas haveconducted hotel visitor surveys. A description of this survey method is presented in Chapter 11.0.

### Parking Surveys

The latest generations of travel demand models haverecognized the importance of parking supply, costs, and subsidies on traveldecisions.  When detailed parkinginformation is needed, parking surveys are sometimes used.  During a parking survey, fieldworkers conductinterviews with, or distribute questionnaires to people as they enter or leaveparking facilities, or leave questionnaires on the windshields of parked cars.

Parking surveys are similar to workplace/establishmentsurveys in that travelers are usually surveyed at the attraction end of theirtrips, but parking surveys generally seek to collect more detailed informationabout parking and access issues.  Parkingsurvey procedures are presented in Chapter 12.0.

n 3.2   Selectingthe Proper Types of Travel Surveys
---------------------------------------------------

The selection of the proper types of surveys to use indeveloping or enhancing travel models should be based on the type of datarequired for the models, each survey type’ssurvey population, the data available from each type of survey, and the costand complexity of fielding the survey. The cost and complexity of the survey type is related to the actualmarketing research techniques needed to complete the survey effort.

### The Modeling Uses of Survey Data and The Survey Populations

Table 3.1 shows the most common survey population orpopulations and the most common data uses for each type of travel surveyconsidered in this Manual.  In selectingthe most important and cost-effective travel surveys for modeling purposes, theanalyst needs to determine whether the survey type will truly reach the mostappropriate population or universe.  Forinstance, it is important to note that the survey populations for the interceptsurveys are not the travelers, but instead are the trips themselves.  Conversely, the general population surveys,such as the household survey, have populations which are based on thetrip-making unit, not the trip.  Thesedistinctions can have important implications on the models that are developedwith these survey data, particularly when the two types of data are combined.

  
Table 3.1

  
Usually expansion data can be collected in the survey (oralong with the survey) that will allow the modeler to weight the survey resultsto a different survey universe, but the cost of obtaining these data need to beconsidered in deciding whether a particular survey type makes sense.  For instance, the analysis of vehicleintercept surveys generally requires high quality vehicle count andclassification data to expand the survey results.

The most appropriate type of travel survey depends on thedata needs of the surveyor.  Usually,travel modeling analysis requirements dictate the types of surveys that areneeded.  Household travel surveys areparticularly relevant for current travel models.  These surveys can provide information on thenumber and distribution of trips being made and the travel modes being selectedby individuals within households, as well as the household and the individual’s characteristics.  

The other survey types can provide specific data thatmodelers want or need to develop or enhance travel models.  The detailed model plan will determine thedata needs, and therefore the survey types that are needed.

Of course, there are reasons other than travel modeldevelopment/  
enhancement for conducting travel surveys. For instance, transit onboard surveys are often conducted for developingnew transit routes or modifying existing ones. Vehicle intercept surveys are commonly used in site impact planning. Surveys developed for different reasons can be, and often are,used in travel modeling efforts, so it is extremely helpful to design andcoordinate these surveys with this in mind.

### Travel Survey Data

Travel surveys can be used to collect several kinds ofinformation from respondents, including:

·      Factual information about themselves or theirhouseholds or other affiliations (socioeconomic, demographic, employment data);

·      Behavioral travel information about one or moretrips or travel-related activities (revealed preference travel data);

·      Test-of-knowledge information (data used todetermine respondents’familiarity with a particular subject);

·      Attitudinal information and perceptions (datafrom ratings, rankings, or comparisons of actual or hypothetical subjects);

·      Opinion information (data gathered fromopen-ended responses);

·      Stated response travel information (statedpreference data compiled from tradeoff analyses and other hypothetical choiceexercises); and

·      Longitudinal information (data gathered from thesame or similar respondents over a period of time).

Figures 3.1 through 3.6 show example portions oftravel surveys seeking each of the first six of these data types.  The seventh type of data, longitudinalinformation, can actually be any of the first six types, but tracked over aperiod of time through successive surveys.

Each type of survey is well-suited to obtain certain typesof these data.  Figure 3.7summarizes the kinds of data that each type of survey has been or could be usedto collect.  

Traveler and household information is commonly obtainedfrom all the survey types, except surveys of freight movement.  The best types of surveys for collectinglarge volumes of these data are the household travel/  
activity survey and the workplace survey with centrally-distributedquestionnaires.  These survey types arebased on samples of the individuals for which the socioeconomic/demographicdata are being collected, rather than thetrips that they are making, so frequency weighting can be averted.  In addition, when a great amount of thesedata are needed, the intercept survey methods may be practicallyinadequate.  The two most common surveymethods for intercept travel surveys, short interviews of travelers in thecourse of their travel, and personally distributed mailback questionnaires,have limited lengths so it is difficult to include many socioeconomic ordemographic questions in these surveys. Sometimes, the intercept survey types are used as an initial recruitmentfollowed by a household travel/activity survey to obtain the more detaileddata.

Revealed preference travel data can be obtained from anyof the survey types, but the individual survey types are particularlywell-suited for collecting certain types of travel behavior data.  Household surveys are commonly used to obtaindetailed travel and activity diary data. The ability to contact each household member and the ability to use morecomplicated questionnaires with this type of survey make it the best choice forcollecting household diary data. Commercial vehicle surveys can also be used to obtain diary-typeinformation, but generally the sampling units in these surveys are thevehicles, rather than people or households. Diary data are generally not collected using the other types of surveysbecause of the length and complexity of the questions, and because not allhousehold members can be easily contacted through these methods.

The other types of surveys are usually used to collectinformation on the specific trips that respondents were making when they wereintercepted or observed.  The householdand commercial vehicle surveys sometimes

Figure 3.6

  
Figure 3.7

  
also request data on specific individual trips, such aswork trips for households, or the last trip of a particular type for acommercial vehicle, but these data are generally obtained with diary-typequestions.

Attitudinal/perception questions are commonly asked on alltypes of travel surveys.  These questionsare used to obtain quantitative data that support policy decisions, but thedata are generally not used in formal demand models.  Test-of-knowledge and opinion data provideless quantitative information to support policy decisions.  These data are most easily obtained on longersurveys, since questions of these types often need to be preceded by fairlylengthy descriptions to which individuals areasked to respond.  Open-ended opinionquestions are sometimes asked at theend of transit onboard, vehicle intercept, and other interceptsurveys.  The questions are often used tosimply allow interested respondents the opportunity to “sound-off.”  Some surveyors believe that this opportunityencourages individuals to respond to the entire survey.  In many cases, these open-ended responses arenot even entered or coded.

Increasingly, travel surveys are being used to obtainstated response data (usually stated preference data).  These types of data are being obtained inhousehold surveys and in transit onboard and vehicle intercept surveys, but anytype of travel survey could be used to obtain them.

Finally, longitudinal data have been and are beingobtained in household travel/activity surveys. These data may provide those analyzing it with unique travel behaviorinsights, including the measurement of how household travel patterns changeover time and the determination of the relationship between travel andresidential choice.

In the following chapters, specific data items commonlycollected by each travel survey type are tabulated and discussed.

### Available Survey Methods for Travel Surveys

The most common general methods used for surveying thepublic in the U.S. are:

·      Personally administered interviews;

·      Self-administered surveys distributed byintercept methods;

·      Self-administered surveys distributed to groups;

·      Telephone interviews; and

·      Self-administered mail surveys.

Each method has its strengths andweaknesses, and each is the optimal choice for certain circumstances.  Some survey methods are more reasonable thanothers for certain travel survey types. This section outlines the steps of the different survey methods anddiscusses the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

#### Personally Administered Interviews

The most traditional survey methodis the face-to-face interview, in which trained interviewers approach potentialsurvey respondents, request their participation, and ask them the surveyquestions.  Personally administeredtravel interviews can take place in one of four ways:

·      **In-homeInterviews** – Respondents are contacted and interviewed about pastand/or future travel they have conducted. Until the 1970s, this survey method was commonly employed for householdtravel surveys.

·      **PersonalIntercept Interviews** – Respondents are contacted and interviewed inthe course of their travel.  Transitonboard, vehicle intercept, and some establishment surveys employ this method.

·      **WorkplaceInterviews** – Respondents are contacted and interviewed at work.  Some commercial vehicle and workplace surveysuse this survey method.

·      **CentralLocation Interviews** – Respondents are contacted and interviewed atpublic locations, including shopping malls that attract a representative sampling of a travel survey’s population of interest.  This method is not yet common for travelsurveys, but its use is increasing in other surveying fields.

The survey fieldwork procedures for the differentpersonally administered survey methods and for different travel survey typesvary, but in all cases the process for interviewing each potential respondentis similar to that which is shown in Figure 3.8.

As Figure 3.8 shows, the first step in the personallyadministered survey field process is tocontact the respondent.  This mightinvolve a fieldworker knocking on a person’sdoor for in-home surveys, greeting a transit rider on a bus or at a station foronboard surveys, or stopping a vehicle at an interview station for vehicleintercept surveys.  At this point, thepotential respondent can immediately refuse to speak with the interviewer orelse he or she could find out what the interviewer wants.

  
Figure 3.8

  
The interviewer introduces the study, and the respondentcould agree or refuse to participate. For many studies, some respondents that agree to participate are not inthe survey population of interest for one reason or another, so they need to bescreened out.  Screening questions can beas simple as:  “Are you waiting for bus number 5?” or “Are you the head of the household?” or more complicated, such as aseries of questions about the geography of a person’s current or recent trips.  Depending on the respondent’s answer to the screeningquestions, the interviewer may terminate the interview.  If the respondent is determined to be in thesurvey population of interest, then the interview would be conducted.  At this point, the interview could becompleted, or the respondent could break it off or refuse to answer the keyquestions that are needed for the responses to be usable.

Table 3.2 summarizes the most commonly cited positiveand negative aspects of personally administered interviews when compared toother survey methods.  The ways thatthese advantages and disadvantages affect particular travel surveys arediscussed in later chapters.

#### Self-Administered Surveys Distributed by Intercept Methods

A common variant to personal interviews in travel surveysis the personal distribution of self-administered surveys to respondents.  The respondents are asked to complete thesurvey and to return it in some way, usually by mail or by dropping it in aconveniently located collection bin. Figure 3.9 shows an example of a survey process for thismethod.  The intercept, recruitment, andscreening of respondents is essentially the same as for the personal interviewmethod, but rather than interviewing the respondent, the fieldworker simplyhands them a questionnaire to complete.

A number of outcomes are possible:  the respondent could complete thequestionnaire and return it as requested, she or he could simply never returnthe questionnaire, or she or he could return the questionnaire in unusablecondition.  If a returned questionnaireis unusable but provides respondent address or telephone information, it mightbe possible to recontact the respondent for additional information to make theresponse usable.

The advantages and disadvantages of this survey methodwith respect to other methods are summarized in Table 3.3.

#### Self-Administered Surveys Distributed to Groups

For some survey efforts, it is possible to assemble groupsof respondents to complete self-administeredsurveys.  This survey method seeks tocombine the advantages of personal interview surveys, such as having theopportunity to explain the questionnaire and answer respondent questions, with   
Table 3.2

  
Figure 3.9

  
Table 3.3

  
the advantages of personally distributed self-administeredsurveys, including the ability to ask questions with long sets of responsecategories or questions that require extraresponse time.  This survey methodis sometimes used to survey hard-to-survey groups, including ethnic groups andspecial-interest groups.  Table 3.4describes the advantages and disadvantages of group surveys.

#### Telephone Interviews

In the past 15 years, the telephone interview survey hasbecome an extremely popular surveying tool, both for transportation surveys andfor other types, as well.  As the cost ofsurvey fieldwork has risen, telephone surveys have become more cost-effective(though less flexible in terms of content) than traditional in-homeinterviews.  Telephone interviewers cancontact several households in the time it takes a field interviewer to travelto one particular home, and telephone interviewers can be supervised much moreeffectively than field interviewers.

Telephone surveys are limited in that only households withtelephones can be contacted.  Nationally,approximately 93 percent of households have telephones, but this percentagevaries from city to city.  Householdswithout phones are more likely to be composed of ethnic minorities, be poorer,and have lower auto ownership rates than households with phones.[[3]](#_ftn3 "_ftnref3")  Since such households are likely to makefewer trips and are less likely to use an automobile for trips, telephonesurveys may bias survey results to some degree.

There are ways to address the potential bias resultingfrom non-telephone households.  If theycan be identified, households without phones can be interviewed in person.  Alternately, households which sharedemographic or other characteristics with non-telephone households can beoversampled.  The U.S. Census Public UseMicrodata Sample (PUMS) can be used to identify these characteristics.

There are two types of telephone surveys.  In the first, a sample of telephone numbersis drawn from available telephone number lists (either published directories orlists from previous survey efforts).  Inthe second type, the sample of numbers is drawn from a random list ofnumbers.  This is known as arandom-digit-dialing (RDD) survey.  

Working off available telephone number lists ordirectories greatly enhances the likelihood that an attempted call will be to aworking phone at a private residence, and in most cases allows the surveyor toknow the   
Table 3.4

  
address of the respondent before calling them (this isparticularly useful for survey efforts with specific study areas or studieswith geographic area quotas or targets). However, the rate of unlisted telephone numbers in the U.S. is high andincreasing.  Table 3.5 shows thepercentage of households with telephones and the percentage of phone numbersthat are unlisted for 100 metropolitan areas.

Many travel surveyors are willing to accept that atelephone survey will be unable to include five to 15 percent of the householdsin an area because the households have no phones, but most surveyors balk atthe idea of excluding up to half the households in a region from a surveysampling frame.  For this reason, RDDsurveys are more commonly used in travel surveys than surveys withdirectories.  Some travel surveyors haveused a combination of the two approaches to maximize the efficiency of thelisted approach, while compensating for the potential bias with RDD surveys.

Regardless of whether a listed approach or an RDD approach(or a combination of the two) is adopted, the process for conducting individualtelephone surveys is similar to that shown in Figure 3.10.  The process diagram assumes that thetelephone survey was designed with the following parameters:

·      Up to threeattempts will be made to a single telephone number (typical telephonetravel surveys allow for between five and 10 attempts);

·      Interviewers hang up if there is no answer after10 rings; and

·      Interviewers do not leave messages on answeringmachines.

Table 3.6 discusses the key advantages anddisadvantages of the telephone interview for travel surveys.

#### Mail Surveys

Mail surveys are commonly used for travel surveys becauseof their low cost and resource requirements; and because of theirsimplicity.  A mail survey in its mostsimple form requires obtaining a complete address list from a source, such as autilities customer database, sending self-administered surveys to thehouseholds, and then simply waiting for replies.  Travelsurveyors have found that response levels can be enhanced through theuse of pre-notification letters and follow-up letters and questionnaires.

Figure 3.11 shows the process for an example mailsurvey.  In this survey, a letter is sentto each potential respondent alerting them to the fact that they will bereceiving a mail survey in a few days. Immediately following the letter, the surveying organization sends themail survey to all the addresses, except those for which the prenotificationletters were returned undeliverable. Once the survey materials have been sent, the surveyor simply waits forresponses.  After approximately sevendays, households

Figure 3.11

  
that have not responded are sent a follow-up letterreminding the respondents of the questionnaire, and after a few more days,those who still have not responded are re-sent the questionnaire.

All the surveys that are returned by respondents are codedand reviewed.  The surveyors then sendletters requesting additional information from respondents whose questionnairesrequire clarification.

Table 3.7summarizes the positive and negative aspects of self-administered mailsurveys.

#### Combinations of Survey Methods

In travel surveys, the basic survey methods are often usedin combination with one another to try to capture the benefits of more than onemethod.  For instance, the most commonapproaches for conducting household travel/activity surveys combine telephoneand mail survey techniques.

Figure 3.12 shows the survey methods that aregenerally used for the different travel surveys.
